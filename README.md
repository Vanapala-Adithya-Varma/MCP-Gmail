# Requirements

## Software

- Windows
- Python 3.12
- Claude Desktop
- Google Cloud account
- Gmail account

Python 3.12 is recommended for this project.

Check your Python version:

```powershell
python --version
```

Expected:

```text
Python 3.12.x
```

---

# Installation

## 1. Clone the Repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Gmail-MCP.git
cd Gmail-MCP
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

This project currently uses MCP 1.x and the `FastMCP` API.

Install the required packages:

```powershell
pip install "mcp==1.30.0" google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib pydantic
```

Verify MCP:

```powershell
pip show mcp
```

You should see:

```text
Name: mcp
Version: 1.30.0
```

> This project currently uses the MCP 1.x `FastMCP` API. Do not install MCP 2.x unless the server implementation is migrated to the MCP 2.x API.

---

# Google Cloud Setup

The Gmail MCP server uses the Gmail API and Google OAuth 2.0.

## 1. Create a Google Cloud Project

Open:

https://console.cloud.google.com/

Create a new project or use an existing Google Cloud project.

---

## 2. Enable Gmail API

Open the Google Cloud API Library and enable:

```text
Gmail API
```

---

## 3. Configure OAuth Consent Screen

Configure the OAuth consent screen for your application.

If the application is in testing mode, add the Gmail account that you want to use as a test user.

---

## 4. Create OAuth Credentials

Create an OAuth Client ID for a desktop application.

Download the credentials JSON file.

Rename it to:

```text
client-secret.json
```

Place it in the root directory of the project:

```text
Gmail-MCP/
└── client-secret.json
```

### Security Warning

Never upload `client-secret.json` to GitHub.

---

# Gmail OAuth Permissions

The project currently uses the following Gmail OAuth scope:

```python
SCOPES = ['https://mail.google.com/']
```

This is a broad Gmail permission.

It allows the application to perform operations such as:

- Read Gmail messages
- Send Gmail messages
- Modify Gmail messages
- Delete Gmail messages

Only authorize the application if you trust the code and understand the permissions being granted.

---

# First Run

Navigate to the project directory:

```powershell
cd D:\Gmail-MCP
```

Run:

```powershell
python mcp_gmail.py
```

On the first run, Google OAuth authentication will open in your browser.

Select the Google account whose Gmail mailbox you want the MCP server to access.

After successful authentication, the OAuth token will be stored locally:

```text
token files/
```

For example:

```text
token files/token_gmail_v1.json
```

The token allows subsequent executions to reuse the Google authorization.

---

# Running the MCP Server

Run:

```powershell
python mcp_gmail.py
```

The server uses MCP STDIO transport and should remain running.

The server entry point is:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

---

# Claude Desktop Configuration

The MCP server can be connected to Claude Desktop using the Claude Desktop MCP configuration.

A typical configuration looks like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Gmail": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python312\\python.exe",
      "args": [
        "D:\\Gmail-MCP\\mcp_gmail.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace:

```text
USERNAME
```

with your Windows username.

Also replace the Python executable path if Python is installed somewhere else.

---

# Find Your Python Executable

Run:

```powershell
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

Example output:

```text
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe
```

Use this path as the `command` in the Claude Desktop configuration.

---

# Claude Desktop MSIX Installation

On some Windows installations, Claude Desktop is installed as a Microsoft Store/MSIX application.

In that case, the normal command:

```powershell
mcp install mcp_gmail.py
```

may return:

```text
Claude app not found
```

If this happens, locate the Claude Desktop package:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Packages" |
Where-Object { $_.Name -like "Claude*" }
```

The Claude configuration may be located inside the package directory under:

```text
LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\
```

Look for:

```text
claude_desktop_config.json
```

Add the Gmail MCP configuration to the existing `mcpServers` object.

---

# Testing the Gmail MCP

After connecting the MCP server to Claude Desktop, test the read operations first.

## Test 1: Search

Ask Claude:

```text
Search my Gmail inbox for the 5 most recent emails.
```

Claude should use:

```text
Gmail-Search-Emails
```

---

## Test 2: Email Details

Ask Claude to retrieve the details of one of the returned messages:

```text
Get the details of the most recent email.
```

---

## Test 3: Email Body

Then ask:

```text
Read the body of that email.
```

---

# Test Email

You can send yourself a test email.

### Subject

```text
Gmail MCP Test Email
```

### Body

```text
Hello!

This is a test email for my Gmail MCP project.

I am testing whether the MCP server can:

1. Find this email
2. Read the email details
3. Read the email body
4. Extract the subject, sender, recipient, date, and labels

Test ID: GMAIL-MCP-001

Regards,
Adithya
```

Then ask Claude:

```text
Search my Gmail for an email with the subject "Gmail MCP Test Email".
```

After finding it:

```text
Read the body of that email.
```

# Security

## Never Commit Credentials

The following files must never be committed to GitHub:

```text
client-secret.json
token files/
.env
API keys
OAuth tokens
private credentials
```

The `.gitignore` file should contain:

```gitignore
client-secret.json
token files/

__pycache__/
*.py[cod]

.venv/
venv/
env/

.vscode/
.idea/

.env
.env.*
```

Before pushing to GitHub, verify:

```powershell
git status --ignored
```

Make sure:

```text
client-secret.json
token files/
```

appear under ignored files.

You can also verify tracked files with:

```powershell
git ls-files
```

The output should not contain:

```text
client-secret.json
token files/token_gmail_v1.json
```

---

# Credential Exposure

If `client-secret.json` or an OAuth token is accidentally committed to a public GitHub repository:

1. Treat the credentials as compromised.
2. Revoke or rotate the affected credentials.
3. Remove the credentials from Git history.
4. Check GitHub security and secret-scanning alerts.
5. Generate new credentials if necessary.

Simply deleting a credential file from the latest commit does not necessarily remove it from Git history.

---

# Troubleshooting

## MCP 2.x Error

If you see:

```text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp.server.fastmcp'
```

check the installed MCP version:

```powershell
pip show mcp
```

This project uses:

```text
mcp 1.30.0
```

Install it with:

```powershell
pip install "mcp==1.30.0"
```

---

## Google Authentication Error

If Google authentication does not complete, run:

```powershell
python mcp_gmail.py
```

and complete the browser authorization.

The browser should eventually display a message indicating that the authentication flow has completed.

---

## Claude Reports "Server disconnected"

Check the Claude Desktop MCP logs.

Common causes include:

- Python process exiting
- Missing `mcp.run()`
- Incorrect Python executable
- Missing dependencies
- Missing `client-secret.json`
- Missing OAuth token
- Incorrect working directory
- Permission errors

Make sure the end of `mcp_gmail.py` contains:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

---

## PermissionError: Windows System32

If you see:

```text
PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied:
'C:\Windows\system32\token files'
```

the application is using the wrong working directory.

The Google API helper should determine the working directory from the client secret file:

```python
working_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(client_secret_file))
```

This ensures the token directory is created relative to the project:

```text
D:\Gmail-MCP\token files\
```

instead of:

```text
C:\Windows\system32\token files\
```

---

# Development

Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Gmail-MCP.git
```

Enter the project:

```powershell
cd Gmail-MCP
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install "mcp==1.30.0" google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib pydantic
```

Add your Google OAuth credentials:

```text
client-secret.json
```

Run the server:

```powershell
python mcp_gmail.py
```
